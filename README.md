PINNs-based option pricing and hedging models for quantitative finance.

This repository contains the code and experiments developed for my thesis, which explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in option pricing and hedging within quantitative finance. Building on the proven ability of PINNs to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in physical sciences, this work adapts the framework to financial applications. Starting from the Black-Scholes model and extending to multi-asset and stochastic volatility models such as Heston, the approach demonstrates the ability of PINNs to generate smooth and accurate pricing surfaces. Importantly, the differentiable nature of these surfaces enables direct computation of financial sensitivities (Greeks), paving the way for dynamic hedging strategies. This repository highlights the flexibility of PINNs in addressing complex PDE-based financial models where closed-form solutions may not exist or numerical methods become computationally intensive.
